# Marlin-V2-for-Ender-3-with-BLT-Touch-Sensor

The Ender 3 is harder to do than the CR-10S and cannot (with the version here) be done with a Windows machine at this time. The reason for this is that there exists a command line which exceeds the line length limit set by Windows. It can be done by IOS and Linux.

Please use VS Code with Platformio installed. You might have to add the u8glib library to Platformio, if it is not already installed, for it to work.

Open the folder in VS Code and then within VS Code open the Configuration.h file in the Marlin folder. Then click build at the bottom of the screen. When done, connect your computer to the 3D printer using a USB cable and upload the software.
